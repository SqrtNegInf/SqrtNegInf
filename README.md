I began programming with a KIM-1 single-board computer, writing in assembly languge (program entry via a hex keypad!). Within a few years I was working at nose-bleed altitude with APL on a mainframe. Since then I've steered a bit more moderate course, using what tools and devices the project at-hand required. What hasn't changed is my eagerness to solve problems by writing code. More please!
